Hello! I am a first-year CS PhD student at Berkeley, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Jacob Steinhardt](https://jsteinhardt.stat.berkeley.edu/). I am interested in developing robust and trustworthy ML systems.

I studied mathematics and computer science at Caltech, where I worked with [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) and [Yuanyuan Shi](https://yyshi.eng.ucsd.edu/).  

See [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17jkbEmK-c69u8qqnYDzJNbo917Qwn6gg/view?usp=sharing) for my CV. 

Outside of work I enjoy baking, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71787702-alex-pan), and walking/hiking.
