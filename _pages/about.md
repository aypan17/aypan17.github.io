I am a final-year undergraduate studying mathematics and computer science at Caltech where I am fortunate to be advised by [Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) and [Jacob Steinhardt](https://jsteinhardt.stat.berkeley.edu/). I am interested in developing trustworthy and reliable machine learning. 

See [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17jkbEmK-c69u8qqnYDzJNbo917Qwn6gg/view?usp=sharing) for my CV. Feel free to email me at aypan [at] caltech [dot] edu.
